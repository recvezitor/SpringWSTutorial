Maven Tutorial

maven.step0
 - show effective pom for empty project
 - show different effective pom for different packaging types (pom vs jar )
mvn help:effective-pom

maven.step1
 - multi-module maven project
 - inheritance vs aggregation
 mvn clean install
 mvn help:effective-pom

maven.step2
- define all dependencies explicitly
- define all dependencies in dependencyManagement section
- define all dependencies versions and scopes using custom properties
- define dependencies as much specific as possible

maven.step3
- define default plugins explicitly
- define helpful plugins
- define other plugins in pluginManagement section
- to override plugin default behaviour use combine.self and combine.children properties in configuration section
mvn dependency:tree
mvn dependency:analyze
mvn versions:display-plugin-updates versions:display-dependency-updates versions:display-property-updates

maven.step4
 - define profiles in root pom only
 - override profiles only in extreme cases
 - profiles could be executed in single command but remember that profiles are merged
 - compilation error possible if you changed module that you depend from

maven.step5
 - scope 'provided'
 - profile ah-functional

maven.step6
- combine.children="append" behaviour for functional profile. Added Integration test
- profile cobertura. Child1 extends cobertura plugin adding 1 exclusions
- NOTE: profile cobertura must not be defined in the root pom since it isn't used by most of modules
but plugin cobertura must be defined in pluginManagement section and redefined in modules that actually use this plugin
